## Start the project

```sh
vagrant up
```

## Connect to the container

```sh
vagrant ssh
```

## Build the project

```sh
cargo build --release
```

## Run the project

```sh
./target/release/example [OPTIONS]
```

Available options:
 * `--consumers` - amount of consumers threads (ex: `--consumers 5`)
 * `--help` - display help details

## Patterns

### Simple queue

A simple queue simply contains a single producer and a single consumer.
The producer pushes messages into the queue while the consumer get messages from the queue.

To run a simple queue, simply run the tool without any option. This mode is the default one.

```sh
./target/release/example
```

### Competing consumers

A single producer, one queue and multiple consumers (also called "workers").
The producer pushes messages into the queue while the consumers get messages from the queue.
Using this tool, the amount of consumers is an amount of internal threads that are started.

To run competiting consumers, run the command with an option indicating the amount of consumers:

```sh
./target/release/example --consumers 2
```

### Message consumed acknowledgement

Consumed messages are kept within the queue as long as the queue does not get an aknowledgement
from the consumer once the message has been consumed.

Without aknowledgement, the message is the re-queued after being consumed.
The message will be re-consumed when new consumers starts.

In order to enable aknowledgement, use the `enable-ack` option:

```sh
./target/release/example --consumers 2 --enable-ack true
```
